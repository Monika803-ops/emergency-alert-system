Safe Walk - Real-Time Emergency Detection

Project Title

Safe Walk: AI-powered safety solution for real-time emergency detection.


Problem Statement 1 :Wave AI magic with groq

Objective

The project aims to provide an AI-based safety solution that monitors emergency keywords through voice recognition and detects suspicious activity through camera vision. If any danger is detected, the system immediately sends an emergency alert to the user‚Äôs designated contact via WhatsApp. This solution helps individuals feel secure without having to touch their phone during a potential emergency situation.

Real-World Use Case:

Walking alone at night or in secluded areas.

Detecting situations where the person may be in danger.

Sending instant alerts to loved ones or guardians for quick action.

My Approach:

Why you chose this problem:
 The personal safety of individuals is a growing concern, especially for women and vulnerable individuals walking alone. This project addresses that by combining real-time AI with an emergency alert system.

Key challenges you addressed:

Integrating voice recognition and vision detection models in real-time without compromising performance.

Handling ambient noise for accurate voice detection.

Implementing a secure WhatsApp messaging system using Twilio for instant alerts.


Any pivots or breakthroughs: While working with Groq models for AI, we encountered challenges with real-time processing, but through threading and efficient resource management, we successfully enabled parallel processing of voice and vision models.

Final Words

This project was an exciting journey of integrating AI with real-world applications for improving personal safety. We faced challenges in processing voice and vision data in parallel, but with careful planning and implementation, we were able to create a functioning prototype. The experience of working with real-time communication systems like Twilio was invaluable, and we look forward to improving Safe Walk further.
